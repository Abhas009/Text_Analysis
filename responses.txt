I am a software engineer with five years of experience in full-stack development. I have worked on several projects involving Python and JavaScript.
My greatest strength is my ability to learn quickly and adapt to new technologies. I believe this makes me a valuable asset to any team.
I struggle with time management sometimes, but I am working on improving my prioritization skills.
